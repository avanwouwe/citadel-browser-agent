# Wazuh integration
Follow the following steps to ship the syslog events to your Wazuh instance.

## change ossec.conf
### macOS
If you haven't already done so, install the [Native Messaging module](/doc/macos.md) that Citadel needs to communicate the events outside browser sandbox.

In the `ossec.conf` file that is deployed on agents, edit the existing `<localfile>` entry to ensure that the syslog events are seen by Wazuh, by adding to the query: `or (process == "citadel-browser-agent" and message beginsWith "browser agent : ")`

```
  <localfile>
    <location>macos</location>
    <log_format>macos</log_format>
    <query type="trace,log,activity" level="info">(process == "sudo") or (process == "sessionlogoutd" and message contains "logout is complete.") or (process == "sshd") or (process == "tccd" and message contains "Update Access Record") or (message contains "SessionAgentNotificationCenter") or (process == "screensharingd" and message contains "Authentication") or (process == "securityd" and eventMessage contains "Session" and subsystem == "com.apple.securityd") or (process == "citadel-browser-agent" and message beginsWith "browser agent : ")</query>
  </localfile>
```



### Windows
If you haven't already done so, install the [Native Messaging module](/doc/windows.md) that Citadel needs to communicate the events outside browser sandbox.

In the `ossec.conf` file that is deployed on agents, add the following `<localfile>` entry to ensure that the syslog events are seen by Wazuh.
```
  <!-- Browser Agent -->
  <localfile>
    <log_format>syslog</log_format>
    <location>C:\Program Files\Citadel\logs\CitadelSvc.out.log</location>
    <ignore>, "level": "(DEBUG|TRACE)", </ignore>
  </localfile>
```

# add index template
When the OpenSearch database in Wazuh encounters a new field, it creates the field as "keyword", instead of as "date" or "integer". This prevents them from being used in aggregations functions in dashboards. In order to ensure that the fields are created with the correct types, they have to be defined in the **index template**. Wazuh has a default template that takes care of the standard Wazuh fields, and a second template has to be added that will be merged with the default Wazuh one.

Go to `Indexer management` > `Dev Tools` and call the OpenSearch API with this snippet:
```
PUT _template/wazuh-browseragent
{
  "index_patterns": ["wazuh-alerts-*"],
  "order": 50,
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "data": {
        "properties": {
          "browseragent": {
            "properties": {
              "detail": {
                "properties": {
                  "download": {
                    "properties": {
                      "bytesReceived": { "type": "long" },
                      "fileSize":      { "type": "long" },
                      "totalBytes":    { "type": "long" },
                      "startTime":     { "type": "date" },
                      "endTime":       { "type": "date" }
                    }
                  },
                  "file_select": {
                    "properties": {
                      "size":         { "type": "long" },
                      "lastModified": { "type": "date" }
                    }
                  }
                }
              },
              "numvalue": { "type": "double" }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]  
> This template will only be applied when the **next** index is created, which is generally the next day. If events are injected in the current index, the fields will not be the correct type, and the same field will have different types in different indexes. This may cause strange behaviour elsewhere. You may want to wait until the next index is created, or delete the current index (if it does not contain important information)

# add decoder
In order for the log entries to be converted to events, a decoder has to be defined. In the Wazuh `Server Management` > `Decoders` configuration and create a new decoder file `0590-browser-agent_decoder.xml` and fill it with the contents of [/doc/0590-browser-agent_decoder.xml](/doc/0590-browser-agent_decoder.xml).

# add rules
Events only generate alerts if they are matched by a rule. In Wazuh `Server Management` > `Rules` configuration create a new rules file `0019-browser-agent_rules.xml` and fill it with the contents of [/doc/0019-browser-agent_rules.xml](/doc/0019-browser-agent_rules.xml).

Restart the server for the changes to take effect, for example using the `Restart cluster` > `Server Management` > `Status` menu.

You should start seeing new events show up in the `Threat hunting` module, for example if you visit [http://neverssl.com](http://neverssl.com) and filter in Wazuh for `data.browseragent.event: *`.
