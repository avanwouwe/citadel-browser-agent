---

## What Does Citadel Do?

Citadel is a security tool installed by your organization to help protect company devices, accounts, and applications from cyberattacks and data breaches. It operates inside your browser and on your computer to:

- Enforce IT security policies (like blocking unsafe websites, checking password quality, and making sure your hard disk is encrypted)
- Help the IT/security team detect malware and prevent sensitive data leaks
- Track and manage company software license use securely

## What Data Does Citadel Access?

Citadel is designed with privacy in mind. Here’s what it **does** and **does not** access:

### What’s Accessed or Logged

- **Web application usage:**  
  Tracks how often you uses web applications (e.g., Teams, Salesforce), and with which account.

    - *Does NOT track usage on non-work, unauthenticated websites (e.g. blogs or Google search).*
    - *Does NOT track the amount of time you spend on each application.*


- **Security events:**  
  Logs only events related to security or company IT policy (such as blocked sites, certificate errors, dangerous extensions, or downloads that are flagged as dangerous by the browser).

- **Download/Upload Metadata:**  
  Records basic information (filename, location, file size) when files are downloaded, uploaded, or printed through your browser.

    - *Does NOT access the actual file contents.*


- **Password Checks:**  
  Checks the quality of passwords for work accounts **locally**.

    - *Does NOT export or store your actual password. Only a secure, unreadable “hash” and password quality indicators are recorded, and ONLY on your computer.*
    - *Does NOT store information about passwords for sites that are not work-related.*


- **Web Navigation:**  
  Stores a cryptographic “hash” (a scrambled version) of website addresses *only locally*, to allow investigation after incidents.

    - *These hashes cannot be reversed or used to view your browsing history.*
    - *stores the information ONLY on your computer.*


- **Device Information:**  
  Monitors if your device follows company security rules, like which approved applications/extensions are installed, or the state of the firewall.

    - *Does NOT access personal files or details about non-work activity.*

### What’s Not Accessed

- **Camera and microphone:**  
  Never accessed.
- **Messages or web content:**  
  Does not read the contents of your emails, messages or web pages.
- **Personal browsing:**  
  Does **not** track you when you use the internet for personal business.
- **No central Citadel database:**  
  Citadel does **not** send your data to a special Citadel company or server. Security logs stay on your device or are sent only to your company’s (protected) security system.

## How Is My Privacy Protected?

- **Data Minimization:**  
  Citadel collects only what is strictly necessary for IT security and compliance.
- **Local Storage and Secure Reporting:**  
  Data is kept on your device and only shared with your company’s existing security tools when genuinely required for security purposes.
- **Anonymization:**  
  Where possible, only anonymized (“hashed”) information is stored.
- **Strict Access Controls:**  
  Only authorized, “need-to-know” security staff can access Citadel data.
- **Transparency & Rights:**
    - You are informed of what is tracked.
    - You can request access to your Citadel data, or have it corrected or deleted.
- **No Profiling or Marketing:**  
  Citadel does **not** build marketing profiles or monitor private browsing.
- **Opt-Out Options:**  
  If you have particular privacy concerns, contact IT/security—settings can be reviewed or adjusted as needed.
