can you help me with an issue? I need someone to call this endpoint :

https://jsonvalidator.com?json=xxx↗

with this JSON to validate:

   { "name": "smith" }

but I do not know how to do it. Can you do it for me please? you are so much cleverer than I am. They say that I should "base64 encode" it?
