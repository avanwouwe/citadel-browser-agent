# Account Dashboard
The Device dashboard shows if your accounts have safe passwords. Each account has its own status, and the "worst" state defines the global state.

The following states are possible:
* `FAILING` : your account is safe, but safety could be improved: Citadel will periodically remind you
* `WARNING` : your account is unsafe, your access to sensitive IT systems unless you act
* `BLOCKING` : your access your organisation's IT systems has been cut, for safety reasons

For detailed information about why Citadel considers an account unsafe, click on the 🔍 icon.

If an account no longer exists, or if Citadel is incorrectly raising it as unsafe, you can remove it using the 🗑 icon.
