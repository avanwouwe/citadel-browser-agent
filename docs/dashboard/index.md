# Dashboard
The Citadel dashboard allows you to understand if your device, accounts or extensions are safe or not. The dashboard can be opened by clicking on the Citadel icon, in the extension menu of your browser. The extension menu can generally be reached via a "puzzle piece" next to the search bar, and sometimes fromm the browser main menu. Most browsers allow you to "pin" extensions so that they are visible at all time.
