# Event Dashboard
Your organisation maintains a Security Operations Centre (SOC), that analyzes incoming security events and takes action if required. Citadel is used by the SOC to be alerted of dangerous or malicious activity. Citadel also provides the SOC information that can be used for digital forensic analysis.

The Event Dashboard shows the most recent events that have been logged and sent to the Security Operations Centre of your organisation. 


If an account no longer exists, or if Citadel is incorrectly raising it as unsafe, you can remove it using the 🗑 icon.
