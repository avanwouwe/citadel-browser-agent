# Extension Dashboard
The Extension dashboard shows if your extensions represent an unacceptable risk to your organisation. 

Extensions that represent an unacceptable risk to your organisation are shown as `BLOCKING`, and are disabled for safety reasons.

For detailed information about why Citadel considers an account unsafe, click on the 🔍 icon.

If an account no longer exists, or if Citadel is incorrectly raising it as unsafe, you can remove it using the 🗑 icon.
