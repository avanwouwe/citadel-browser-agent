        <h2>What does this control check?</h2>
        <p>
            The WirelessNetworking control checks for saved wireless networks that use insecure
            or outdated encryption protocols. This includes networks using WEP, open/unencrypted
            networks, or older WPA versions that have known security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Citadel will tell you which specific network(s) are using
            insecure encryption. Weak WiFi encryption is like having a conversation in a room where
            anyone nearby can listen in. Attackers within range of the network can intercept and read
            all data transmitted between your Mac and the WiFi router - including passwords, emails,
            messages, and any information you send or receive. They can also perform man-in-the-middle
            attacks, inserting themselves between you and websites to steal credentials or inject malicious
            content. Using insecure wireless networks exposes everything you do online to potential eavesdroppers.

                <h3>Traffic Interception</h3>
                <p>Weak WiFi encryption allows attackers to capture and read all your network traffic,
                    including passwords, emails, and sensitive data transmitted over the network.</p>

                <h3>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks</h3>
                <p>Insecure networks make it easy for attackers to position themselves between you and
                    the websites you visit, stealing credentials and injecting malicious content.</p>

                <h3>Automatic Connection Risk</h3>
                <p>If saved, your Mac may automatically connect to these insecure networks without warning,
                    exposing you to attacks whenever you're in range.</p>
