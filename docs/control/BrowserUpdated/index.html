        <h2>What does this control check?</h2>
        <p>
            The BrowserUpdated control verifies that your browser has been restarted
            recently. Modern browsers download updates automatically in the background,
            but they require a restart to actually apply these updates and protect you
            from security vulnerabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Important:</strong> Just because your browser downloads updates doesn't mean
            you're protected. Updates only take effect after you restart your browser. Running
            an outdated browser leaves you vulnerable to known security exploits that attackers
            actively use to compromise systems.

                <p>Browser updates frequently contain critical security fixes for newly discovered
                    vulnerabilities. Without restarting, these patches remain inactive, leaving you
                    exposed to attacks that could steal your data or compromise your accounts.</p>

        <h2>Automatically Restoring Your Tabs</h2>
        <p>
            One of the main reasons people avoid restarting their browser is the fear of losing
            all their open tabs. Fortunately, all modern browsers can automatically restore your
            previous session when you restart.
        </p>

        <div class="method">
            <h4>Configure your browser to restore tabs:</h4>
            <p>
                Visit your <a href="#" id="startup-config-link">browser's startup configuration</a> page to enable this feature.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Recommended practice:</strong> Enable automatic tab restoration and restart
            your browser at least once a week. Many users restart daily (end of workday) to ensure
            they always have the latest security updates and a fresh browser session.

        <h2>Verifying the fix</h2>
        <p>After restarting your browser, Citadel will automatically verify this control and update
            your security status.</p>

        <div class="method">
            <h4>To confirm your browser restarted correctly:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Check that your browser's version number hasn't changed (it may have updated)</li>
                <li>Look for any "Welcome" or "What's New" messages that might indicate an update was applied</li>
                <li>Verify that Citadel shows this control as passing</li>

        <div class="note">
            <strong>Note:</strong> If you configured your browser to restore tabs, you should see your
            previous tabs reopening automatically. This confirms the feature is working correctly.

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>How often should I restart my browser?</h4>
            <p>
                We recommend restarting your browser at least once a week, preferably more often.
                Many security-conscious users restart their browser daily. If you see an update
                notification from your browser, restart it as soon as convenient.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>Will I lose my browsing history or bookmarks?</h4>
            <p>
                No. Restarting your browser only closes the application temporarily. All your
                bookmarks, history, passwords, and settings remain intact. With tab restoration
                enabled, even your open tabs will return.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>What if I'm in the middle of something important?</h4>
            <p>
                Save your work first, then restart when convenient. For web-based applications,
                make sure anything you're working on is saved. Most modern web apps auto-save,
                but it's always best to verify before closing.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <h4>My browser says it will update automatically. Why do I need to restart?</h4>
            <p>
                Your browser downloads updates in the background, but it cannot replace its own
                running code. The new, secure version only loads when you restart the browser.
                Until then, you're still running the old, potentially vulnerable version.
