There are a lot of moving parts: Citadel needs to be installed in the browser, on the OS, and in your SIEM. Nevertheless, installation of Citadel should be relatively straightforward. The [the installer](https://github.com/avanwouwe/citadel-browser-agent/releases/latest) takes care of everything except integration into your SIEM. Everything is explained in the [installation guide](/install/).

Also check out the [configuration manual](/config/) to understand how you can adapt Citadel to your organisation, for example by configuring your logo, name and support e-mail address.
